# Spring Boot "Microservice" Example Project

This is a sample Java / Maven / Spring Boot (version 1.5.6) application that can be used as a starter for creating a microservice complete with built-in health check, metrics and much more. I hope it helps you.

```
        java -jar target/spring-boot-rest-example-0.0.1.jar
or
        mvn spring-boot:run 
```
